      <p>
        Grammerhub is a meetup for new Devs pursuing their first Dev job, those
        leveling up their skills for mid-level positions, or just starting in
        programming looking for a career switch -
        <span>Although all are welcome to join the conversation!</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goals for Grammerhub&#39;s weekly Monday coding nights*:
        <ul>
          <li>Support independent projects and collaboration</li>
          <li>Build a community and provide accountability</li>
          <li>Provide opportunities to grow professionally with technology</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Who We Are: A grassroots group of volunteers applying our skills in
        technology, design, research, and more to support those looking to reach
        the next level in their Dev careers.
      </p>
      <p>
        How it works:
        <ul>
          <li>
